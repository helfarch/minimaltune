minimaltune
===========

Lightweight, but very accurate guitar tuner for OSX (compilable in Windows), built in Processing.

To run, get `minimaltune.app` and run it as usual.

Includes two modes:
+ *chromatic,* which detects what string you're playing and employs the analog-style display
+ *notes,* in which you play the string, click the corresponding string button and tune by ear.

NOTE: to launch on Windows, you can download [Processing](http://processing.org "Processing") and recompile the source code. Or submit a pull request with a Win version, I have no time to do it :/
